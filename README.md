# IoT-based Smart Irrigation System

## Overview
This project is aimed at enhancing agricultural practices through digital and technological advancements. This system is designed to monitor crucial environmental factors such as soil moisture, sunlight, temperature, and humidity around plants. Additionally, it provides automated irrigation control to ensure optimal plant growth conditions. The primary goal is to develop an IoT-based system that allows for remote monitoring and automation of essential factors influencing plant growth, thereby optimizing plant growth and promoting sustainable agriculture.


## Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller board
- **16Ã—2 LCD Display**: For displaying real-time data
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures soil moisture level
- **5V 1-Channel Motor**: Controls the DC water pump
- **DC Water Pump**: Pumps water to the plants
- **Arduino IDE**: Software for programming and control

### Libraries Used
- `dht.h`
- `LiquidCrystal.h`

## Working of the components
### Data Collection
- **DHT22 Sensor**: Collects temperature and humidity data.
- **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures soil moisture levels.

### Data Processing
- **Arduino UNO**: Processes the data and compares soil moisture data to predefined thresholds.

### Display and Decision-Making
- **Arduino UNO**: Displays sensor data on the 16x2 LCD.
- Makes decisions regarding irrigation based on collected data.

### Irrigation Control
- Activates the motor and water pump if soil moisture is below the threshold.

### Data Logging and Remote Access
- Logs data and potentially sends it to the cloud for remote access.

### Automation and Alerts
- Continuously monitors and adjusts environmental conditions.
- Sets up alerts or notifications for any issues or deviations.


## Working Demonstration

1. When the moisture sensor is not plugged in, the moisture reading is 0.
2. When plugged into water, the moisture reading increases.
3. If moisture is below the desired threshold, the water motor activates automatically to irrigate the soil.
